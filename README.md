<h2>Setup</h2>

<li>Launch the game, you can change the settings for BailOutMode in the game settings (BailOutMode defaults to off)</li>
<li>You can change the position of the fail counter text in UserData\modprefs.ini with the FailCounterPosition setting. The format is "#,#,#" (i.e. FailCounterPosition=0,.3,2.5). It represents the x,y,z of the text from the middle of the platform (where the feet are).</li>
